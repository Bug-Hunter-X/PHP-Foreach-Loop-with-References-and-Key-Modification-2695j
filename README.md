This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to using references in foreach loops when modifying array keys. The `bar` function incorrectly modifies the array keys, leading to unexpected behavior and skipping array elements. The `foo` function shows the correct and expected behavior.  The solution illustrates how to avoid this problem by using a standard foreach loop or by creating a copy of the array.
